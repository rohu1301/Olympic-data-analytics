 üìä A Big Data Analytics & Visualization Project


  About the Project

The Olympic Data Analytics Dashboard is an interactive web application that turns Olympic history into visual insights.
Built using Python, Pandas, and Streamlit, this project analyzes thousands of athlete records spanning over a century of Olympic Games.

The goal is to apply Big Data Analytics concepts to explore performance trends, country participation, and athlete achievements ‚Äî all through a clean, interactive dashboard interface.

It‚Äôs not just a data visualization project ‚Äî it‚Äôs a hands-on example of how data science and sports analytics come together to tell stories hidden in data.



## What This Project Does

* Analyzes Olympic Games data using real-world big datasets.
* Displays medal counts, country performance, and athlete records interactively.
* Helps users understand how participation and performance evolved over decades.
* Offers a clean, responsive dashboard powered by Streamlit and Plotly visuals.



## Features

* Big Data Analysis ‚Äì Works on large Olympic datasets efficiently using Pandas.
* Medal Insights ‚Äì Explore medal tallies by country and year.
* Country Participation ‚Äì Visualize how nations joined and performed over time.
* Athlete Performance ‚Äì Find the most successful athletes and their sports.
* Trend Visualization ‚Äì Analyze long-term Olympic trends with beautiful graphs.
* Interactive UI ‚Äì Built with Streamlit for a smooth and modern user experience.

## Tech Stack

 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/olympic-data-analytics.git](https://github.com/yourusername/olympic-data-analytics.git)
   cd olympic-data-analytics

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Make sure both dataset files are in the same directory:
   athlete_events.csv
   noc_regions.csv

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run copy_of_olympic_data_analytics.py

5. Open your browser ‚Äî Streamlit will automatically launch the dashboard.

 Insights You Can Discover

* Which countries dominate in medals and participation.
* The rise of women‚Äôs participation over time.
* How athlete age, height, and weight vary by sport.
* The most successful Olympians and their achievements.
* Medal trends across decades and sports.


Why It Matters for Big Data Analytics

This project showcases how Big Data techniques can be applied beyond business ‚Äî in sports and history.
It involves:

* Cleaning and processing large datasets efficiently.
* Extracting insights using analytical tools.
* Visualizing data interactively for better understanding.

 Future Plans

* Add machine learning for medal prediction.
* Integrate cloud-based Big Data tools like Spark or BigQuery.
* Include Winter Olympics data.
* Enhance UI/UX with custom Streamlit themes.
